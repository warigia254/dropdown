# dropdown
The essence of this is to replace the current page we have on Mwalimu Central where the users select the documents they need. I find the current page too busy with all the images. I would also want a quicker process of getting the documents. The dropdown which is also a multiple select will allow users to get all the need with very few clicks. 
The dilemma right now is that the first dropdown is working well but the second and third are not. 
My desire is to have users download the documents at level 3 and move this to the 'cart' for purchase and download.
I will have a separate dropdown for the curriculum designs. 
This is a cloned project.
